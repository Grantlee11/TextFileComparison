# TextFileComparison
 I created this C# program to take 2 different text files, an older file, and a newer file, where the old file is a subset of the new file. The program will then create a "Difference" text file contain all the different lines of text between the old and new files. This is useful for finding out exactly which lines of texts are new. I created this when I needed to know the difference between 2 very large CSV files with the required prereqs met.  Note: Running this program will overrite a "Difference.txt" file in the directory its set too, so be sure to make the needed changes when using this code to prevent any unwanted changes to your files.  Feel free to use the code and modify it however you like.
